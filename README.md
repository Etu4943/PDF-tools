# PDF-tools
This repo is my first big project. The idea is to easily manipulate PDFs. I can't count how many times I was wondering "How can I merge several pdf files into one ?". Well, starting today, I'm working on a tool that will make this task easy, and user friendly.

All icons used in this project are from the designer Yusuke Kamiyamane. His work is available here : [https://p.yusukekamiyamane.com/](https://p.yusukekamiyamane.com/)

Voici un aperçu à jour de l'avancement du projet :
